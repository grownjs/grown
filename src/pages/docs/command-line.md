You may want to seperate the application code from the server initialization, e.g.

**your-app/application.js**

```js
// require and create a Grown-container
const Grown = require('grown')();

module.exports = () => {
  // create the web-server instance
  const server = new Grown();

  return server;
};
```

There's no need to start the server manually, it'll be handled by the `CLI` extension.

Get `@grown/cli` globally to start your application:

```bash
$ npm install -g @grown/cli
$ cd your-app
$ grown up
```

Try `grown --help` to get more usage info.
